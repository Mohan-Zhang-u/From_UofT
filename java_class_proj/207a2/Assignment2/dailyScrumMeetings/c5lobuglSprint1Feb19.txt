What did I do last time?
    - I've added some common methods for all Commands to the Command superclass.

What do I plan to do now?
    - focus on, brain storm and aim to create a system or find a way out to how to modify the directory
    - Set up the File System (Classes File, Directory, and FileSystem)

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Not really.
