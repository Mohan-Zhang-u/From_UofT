What did I do last time?
    - there is no last time and since its reading week I and my partner are out
 for 3 days.

What do I plan to do now?
    - focus on, brain storm and aim to create a system or find a way out to how to modify the directory
    - try to finish cd and help with mkdir

Am I blocked on anything?
    - how to print those errors correctly.
