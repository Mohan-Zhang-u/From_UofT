What did I do last time?
    - I've implemented and documented Command, File, and Directory. I breifly worked on implementing FileSystem, though it is not documented.

What do I plan to do now?
    - Help make skelleton for all Command classes, allow for JShell to function
    - Finish and test the FileSystem
    - Work on all assigned Commands I will be given in sprint2

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Not really.
