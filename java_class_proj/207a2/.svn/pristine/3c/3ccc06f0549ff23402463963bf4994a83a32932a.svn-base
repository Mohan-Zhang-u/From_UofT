What did I do last time?
    - figuring out how we can accomplish those things.
    - Use trees?

What do I plan to do now?
    - focus on, brain storm and aim to create a system or find a way out to how to modify those directories using exist Jshell.java file and create more .java files to accomplish them.
    - try to finish cd and help with mkdir

Am I blocked on anything?
    - are we going to create a file system by ourselves?
