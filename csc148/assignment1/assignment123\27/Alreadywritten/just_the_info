n this assignment, you'll build an event-driven simulation for a grocery store,
which will model customers using different types of checkout lines.


Your finished product will be able to set up the simulation with data from file inputs, simulate a sequence of events,
and report timing statistics after the simulation is complete that will help determine how successful the checkout line
set-up was for that set of customer arrivals.

giving each customer a unique string identifier.
The number of items influences how long it takes for the customer to check out,

Customers go to a checkout line to pay for their items. The number of items influences how long it takes for the
customer to check out, but what those items are does not, and so the simulation should only keep track of the
number of items each customer has.

The new events should be spaced 1 second apart
assume there is always at least one open line that has space for the customer.

the final timestamp should consider the final customer whose check line is closed.
